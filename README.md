# rdrama-webp
ghetto """fix""" so you can actually view downloaded images without having to manually change the extension

install violentmonkey or tampermonkey or whatever userscript extension you use and then import https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cant-be-blenk/rdrama-webp/master/rdrama-webp-downloader.js i think there's a way to auto do it but i'm too lazy for that
